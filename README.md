# Excel_FIle_Handler
This is a basic excel file handler created in python
for copying the excel files i'm using pandas.
Event handling is achived by the watchdog module and an onbserver.
The way i'm moving files is through the module shutil.
Other modules as 'os' or 'platform' are used to determine some path and other system important elements.
